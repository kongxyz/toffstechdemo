			<p>We can set up our website hosting facilities on our Elastic Virtual Platform to ensure all users 
			are able to transact during peak periods.</p>

			<p>No more scrambling to load more servers or telecom circuits during peak season.</p>

			<p>TOFFS provides Elastic Scalable Computing to increase or decrease capacity within minutes. Your 
			application can automatically scale itself up and down depending on its needs with complete control 
			of your virtual server instances. You have root access to each one, and you can interact with them as 
			you would any physical machine.</p>

			<p>TOFFS also provide Flexible Cloud Hosting Services with a choice of multiple instance types, operating 
			systems, and software packages. You can select a configuration of memory, CPU, instance storage, and the boot 
			partition size that is optimal for your choice of operating system and application. For example, your choice 
			of operating systems includes numerous Linux distributions, and Microsoft Windows Server.</p>
