				<p>The Institute of Technical Education (ITE) has collaborated with local startup TOFFS Technologies to launch 
				a cybersecurity network operations training lab in Singapore.</p>

				<p>Set to open in October this year at the ITE College East campus, the lab is part of a three-year collaboration 
				between the two parties.</p>
				<p>Experts from TOFFS Technologies will provide hands-on training at the lab to higher NITEC (National Institute Of 
				Technical Education Certificate) students who are studying the CYNS (Cyber & Network Security) course.</p>

				<p>During the 12 training sessions conducted bi-weekly, students will be taught related cybersecurity topics such as 
				IT Security technical support and attack analysis. This aims to hone their cyberskills and inspire them to become 
				Network Operations Centre (NOC) specialists after they graduate.</p>
				<p>Students will also learn how to develop prototypes for cyber network solutions on mobile and web application 
				platforms during the training.</p>
				<p>They will receive a Certificate of Participation at the end of the 12th session.</p>
				<p>"The shortage of NOC experts in Singapore has left companies, especially small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) 
				vulnerable to cyberthreats. As a homegrown company, we hope to contribute to Singapore's cybersecurity push by 
				inspiring and training the next generation of cybersecurity experts," explained Jason Kong, co-founder and director, 
				TOFFS Technologies.</p>
				<p>Aside from the training lab, TOFFS will issue bursaries worth S$6,000 to students with outstanding performance 
				in the CYNS course, as well as progressive students from the ICT (infocomm technologies) course. Recipients of these 
				awards will also be given an opportunity to be part of a six-month internship with the startup.</p>
