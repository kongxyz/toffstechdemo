			<p>DNS is a critical component to ensuring online services remain available and that end users are able to connect to 
			those services as quickly as possible. With revenue-generating web applications, customer satisfaction, and employee 
			productivity all dependent on DNS, you can’t afford to have your DNS service unavailable or underperforming for any amount 
			of time. Yet, because DNS mostly “just works,” many organizations treat the protection of their DNS infrastructure as an 
			afterthought even though they know, or should know, that it represents the lynchpin of almost everything they do online.</p>

			<p>Relying upon a single DNS domain is an extremely risky proposition. If that name server should lose connectivity, be hit 
			by denial of service attack or even natural disaster, it essentially takes every other DNS-reliant system down with it.</p>

			<p>Your DNS should have sufficient geographical and topographical diversity in the physical location to protect from these 
			sorts of attacks. Particularly, you should consider varying your DNS servers across multiple power grids and continents.</p>

			<p>Even if your organization rarely sees targeted attacks against it, you should not keep all your DNS eggs in one basket. 
			The bad guys today, in command of botnets sometimes comprising tens of thousands of nodes, have more than enough bandwidth 
			at their command to disrupt all but the best-provisioned Internet presence.</p>

			<p>For a good, reliable DNS setup for your domain(s), you should have</p>

				<li><i class="fas fa-circle pre-icon"></i>Two authoritative DNS for your domain</li>
				<li><i class="fas fa-circle pre-icon"></i>The DNS servers should be connected to different physical networks and power supplies</li>
				<li><i class="fas fa-circle pre-icon"></i>The DNS servers should be in different geographical areas</li>
			</ul>

			<p>TOFFS Multi-DNS solution serves as a redundant complement to your existing DNS service to ensure your most critical applications 
			remain available and that end users reach those applications faster than with any other solution.</p>

			<p>Our Multi-DNS sits on top of our partner global anycast network that delivers industry-leading response times worldwide, as well 
			as 24 x 7 protection against Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks at the DNS layer.</p>

			<p>For organizations with more modest needs, distributing zone data between more than one location and using more than one resolution 
			provider, can immediately mitigate the risks of downtime from DNS outages.</p>

			<p>Our Toffs Multi-DNS solution can ensure greater availability and reliability for your DNS name resolution. Our dual DNS solution 
			serves as a redundant complement to your existing DNS service to ensure your most critical applications remain available and that end 
			users reach those applications faster than with any other solution.</p>
