			<p>TOFFS provides both Real User Monitoring and Synthetic Monitoring for your website. With over 140 PoPs in various cities 
			in China and Asia Pacific, we monitor the experience of a enduser connecting to your website and is able to provide the data 
			breakdown from DNS to first byte to load and the whole pageload performance of end users in various cities</p>
			<p>Waterfall charts are diagrams that let you visualize data that is generated cumulatively and sequentially across a process. 
			In the case of performance waterfalls, they let you see the series of actions that occur between a enduser and your server in 
			order for that user to view a specific page of your site.</p>

			<h1 class="small-main-title">Real User Monitoring (RUM)</h1>		

			<p>Real User Monitoring measures performance the actual users are visiting and interacting with the web application. Using Cedexis 
			Radar, this is a passive approach in which the actual users provides the data to the Cedexis Platform. Real User Monitoring is 
			generally performed by embedding Java scripts within the web pages (web page code), which then collect all relevant performance 
			data and send along for analysis.</p>
