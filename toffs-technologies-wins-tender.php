			Against Complex, Large-Scale DDoS Attacks</h1>

				<p>A consortium comprising Multi-Content Delivery Network (MCDN) solutions provider TOFFS Technologies 
				and Embrio Enterprises Pte. Ltd. has been awarded the Singapore government bulk tender for the provision 
				of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) mitigation services . The consortium will provide DDoS mitigation 
				services to government ministries, government departments, organs of state, statutory boards and 
				participating universities, as part of a multimillion-dollar three-year con-tract.</p>

				<p>Jason Kong, Co-Founder and Director (Technology) of TOFFS Technologies said: "A Multi-Content Delivery 
				Network (CDN) strategy will improve the availability and performance of government websites, as well as 
				protect the websites from volumetric bot attacks from IOT devices and target-ed web application attacks 
				(such as SQL injections) typically used by hackers to steal data."</p>
				<p>DDoS attacks aim to disrupt services to end users by flooding a website with traffic. In the event of a DDOS 
				attack, a Multi-CDN service helps to distribute traffic across multiple CDNs and endpoints to ensure the business’ 
				website content is always available even if a CDN service is down.</p>
				<p>Kong says: “TOFFS Technologies’ multi-CDN strategy ensures that organisations will have a fallback should any 
				CDN provider suffer an outage. In the wake of the Dyn DDoS attack, organisations are beginning to address the wide 
				usage of DNS (Domain Name System) as an attack vector. We are now also advising our customers to adopt a multi-DNS 
				strategy in addition to a multi-CDN strategy to boost their cyber defence posture.”</p>
				<p>TOFFS Technologies has seen a 300 percent growth in demand for its multi-CDN services from a broad spectrum of 
				industries such as gaming and hospitality since its inception in 2014. TOFFS Technologies is the only company in the 
				Asia-Pacific region providing multi-CDN services. The company uses a load balancer to distribute traffic between 
				multiple CDN providers.</p>
