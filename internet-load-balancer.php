			<p>This service enables your website to achieve 100% availability through active-active or active-standby global 
			load balancing across multiple-cloud regions, data centers and/or CDNs. You are only limited by your imaginations. 
			The Intelligent CedexisOpenmix global platform provides configurable service that maximizes cloud availability and 
			performance based on the end-user experience optimization.</p>

			<p>Our customers benefit from a single point of control for global traffic management, allowing for seamless switching 
			from your origin data centers to virtualized cloud environments to the CDN of your choice and back again. We help optimizes 
			end-users web requests on a global basis and give the enterprise the capability to leverage on a cost effective balance between 
			the origin data center and various Content Delivery Networks of each region. This is coupled with the ability to allow the end-user 
			to be served from the most optimum CDN provider, resulting in the best online end user experience.</p>

			<p>End user data reveals that CDN performance varies significantly between end-user ISPs, and these performance differentials 
			change continuously throughout the day. The largest CDNs only peer or have servers directly in a subset of the global ISPs in 
			the world. For those networks that are not directly peered with the CDNs, end users must transit across other networks to get 
			access to CDN servers which results in slower access.</p>

			<p>The use of real-time load balancing between multiple CDNs optimizes availability, latency and throughput, by routing traffic 
			to the best-performing content source, moment by moment.</p>

			<p>Organizations are ensured that they attain 100% availability even during traffic spike or cyber-attacks via their 
			configuration rules' threshold.</p>
			<p>This Always On Intelligent Routing ensures that the organizationâ€™s website is available 100%, at all time.</p>
